The basic idea is to paint the last n seconds, in 60-second lines, showing dots
if the timer is on, nothing (a space) if it's off, and showing an x (or
something) when the counter is incremented.

The screen is repainted every second. Various stats appear below the 60-second
lines. The time is shown as well.

As to classes, it seems to me not many are needed. I guess I can see a
SecDisplay class (for the display of the seconds) and a Stats class (for the
calculation and display of the stats). In addition, a Runner class, which
interprets the commands.

So far I've had no need for different categories of classes. Therefore, in the
Runner class, I'll just have start, stop (which is like pause if you don't
clear), clear (which is like restart), and quit (the program).

Classes:
* Counter
* Stats (a subclass of Counter, so that a Stats obj has access to the Counter)
* Dots (ditto)

The dots are
